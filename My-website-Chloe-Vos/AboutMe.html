      <p>Hello! Thank you for dropping in and welcome to my
       website - my name is Chloe. <br>Allow met te tell you a bit about myself.
       I'm an adventurouse 16 year old and I love photography, food, nature and
       am fascineted by people.  I also LOVE to travel, unfortunately my lack of
       income does not support this lifestyle. Therefore I do the next best thing,
       I explore my city as much as I can.  Let me show you some of the best spots
       I have visited in and around Cape Town.
      </p>
