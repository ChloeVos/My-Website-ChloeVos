    <div class="about"
    <p>The Alpaca Loom is such a cute place to visit when you are
      looking for something different to do.This is a fun and entertaining
      experience to be able to feed the alpacas and see them play
      and even fight with eachother. A packet of food to feed the
      llamas are about R20, which in my opinion isn't a lot. I also
      enjoyed the Cafe's hot chocolate and alpaca themed cupcakes
      they served. It is definitely a family friendly outing and can
      even be a nice scenery for photoshoots. I totally recommend!
