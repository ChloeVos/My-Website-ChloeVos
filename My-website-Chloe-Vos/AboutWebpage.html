    <p><b><i>Are you ready for the adventure?</i></b> Great! <br>On this website
      you will see all the places I have visited thus far.  I rated it and also
      categorized it so it is easy and simple for you to choose a place you want to
      visit. Sometimes I go to places that are for free and other times you need some
      money for entrance or spending. Either way you will have amazing experiences and
       make unforgettable memories.
      Cape Town ... oh how I love you!
